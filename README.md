Diagnose COPD using lungs sound based on Raspberry Pi.

## How it works
This is a project that I did for my thesis. He're I'm using Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) to get the feature of the lung sound and pass it to a Backpropagation artificial neural network model to classify whether the sound is indicated by COPD or Healthy. Also, I'm using matplotlib to visualize the lung signal. I'm not adding any calibration to the stethoscope since every stethoscope is different. You can add it by yourself.
